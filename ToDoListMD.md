Ok, so, I'm finishing up the Codecademy lesson on Ruby. I did it once in Spain, which was helpful. However, when I did it then I didn't understand a lot of what they were teaching. So, I decided to do it again this month and take notes (which was easier because I had a frame of reference.) It went much better. And faster.

I signed up for the PRO version, which gives me access to a final project. For the Javascript course (which I am about 3/4 of the way through) the PRO projects are imbedded into the course. However, it turns out that for the Ruby class there are no imbedded projects. Instead, there is one big final project which takes you out of the Codecademy environment and has you use 'real' workflow to complete the project.

To more closely mimic that 'real' workflow, I am going to try to journal my experience here for us (read, to you, but really also for me.)
